# DPLL Satisfiability Solver

This project implements various versions of SAT solvers, including the most basic form which uses brute force to solve problems, a branching version which recursively checks for a solution, and a proper DPLL sat solver that implements watched literals (WL) alongside clause learning (CL) and a basic heuristic. 

The references of sources used for researching WL and CL are included at the top of the main file, jssb25.py. The file test.py only remains as a remnant of trying to implement the researched material into code.
